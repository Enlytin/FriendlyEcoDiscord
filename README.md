# FriendlyEconomyDiscord
The repo for custom built economy bot for use with discord.

The main.py is the entry point. Running this file will load all cogs and commands from /cogs, as well as safely initialize the SQLITE database.

Please note that you need your own token to run the bot as the main token will not be publicly available for privacy reasons.
